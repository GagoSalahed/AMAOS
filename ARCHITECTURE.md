# AMAOS Architecture

## System Overview

AMAOS is designed as a cloud-native, distributed system with the following key architectural principles:

- **Modularity**: Loosely coupled components for easy extensibility
- **Reliability**: Built-in fault tolerance and graceful degradation
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling and load balancing
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers

## Core Components

### Task Orchestrator

The central coordinator that:
- Routes tasks to appropriate agents
- Manages task dependencies and execution flow
- Handles retries and fallbacks
- Enforces rate limits and circuit breaking

### Agent System

Multiple agent types with different capabilities:
- **CrewAI Teams**: Structured task execution with role-based agents
- **AutoGen Teams**: Conversational problem-solving with emergent behavior
- **Hybrid Teams**: Combined capabilities for complex workflows
- **Judge Agent**: Quality assurance and output validation

### Memory Management

Multi-tiered memory system:
- **Redis Cache**: Fast access to recent data
- **Vector Store**: Semantic search and long-term storage
- **Tiered Memory**: Automatic data lifecycle management

### Tool Layer

Extensible tool system with:
- File operations
- Web interactions
- Terminal commands
- Custom tool support
- Tool sandboxing

### Security Layer

Defense-in-depth approach:
- **Secrets Management**: Secure key storage and rotation
- **RBAC**: Fine-grained access control
- **Network Policies**: Strict communication rules
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive activity tracking

### Monitoring Stack

Full observability suite:
- **Prometheus**: Metric collection
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Alert Manager**: Intelligent alerting
- **Distributed Tracing**: Request tracking
